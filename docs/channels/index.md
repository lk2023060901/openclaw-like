# Chat Channels

OpenClaw can talk to you on any chat app you already use. Each channel connects via the Gateway.
Text is supported everywhere; media and reactions vary by channel.

## Supported channels

- [Feishu](/channels/feishu) — Feishu/Lark bot via WebSocket.
- [WebChat](/web/webchat) — Gateway WebChat UI over WebSocket.

## Notes

- Channels can run simultaneously; configure multiple and OpenClaw will route per chat.
- DM pairing and allowlists are enforced for safety; see [Security](/gateway/security).
- Troubleshooting: [Channel troubleshooting](/channels/troubleshooting).
- Model providers are documented separately; see [Model Providers](/providers/models).
